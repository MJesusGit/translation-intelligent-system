	\label{sec:intro}
	\begin{flushleft}
	Given the increase in globalisation, every day we are in contact with a greater number of cultures, which forces us, in a healthy way, to learn new languages.

	However, thanks to the development of technology and artificial intelligence, it is not necessarily necessary to study a language for years in order to understand it, given that translator websites and the translators themselves allow us to interact with it fluently.

	It is an opportunity to broaden our knowledge and understanding of other languages. As well as guaranteeing the correct use of the language for work and business, as they not only translate a language but also interpret emotions and feelings.

	\section{First aproaches}
	\label{sec:examples}
	\begin{flushleft}
	Today, machine translation is no longer a science fiction fantasy, it has been in continuous development for years, but the nuances of a language are difficult and that is why it has only been developed to a certain extent.\par
	
	In the early years around 1949, Warren Weaver, of the Rockefeller Foundation, set up a cryptography and language processing machine that was a precursor to the concept of machine translation. This project can be found in his "Memorandum on Translation".\par

    In 1954 the founding research team of the Georgetown-IBM experiment carried out a demonstration of a machine that could translate 250 words from Russian into English.\par
    
    With this advance, people thought that machine translation would soon solve many problems and many translators began to fear for their jobs. However, the human brain is better able than a computer to access the complex framework of meaning, interpretation and syntax. In 1964, the Advisory Committee for Automatic Language Processing (ALPAC) declared that further investment in machine translation was no longer worthwhile.\par

    During the 1970s and 1990s Canada did not think like ALPAC, it developed the METEO system, which translated meteorological reports from English into French, capable of translating 80,000 words a day and was such a success that it was used until the first half of the 21st century.\par\par\par
    
    In addition, machine translation was used by the French textile industry institute to convert French summaries into English, German and Spanish. Around the same time, Xerox created its own system for translating technical manuals. At that time, machine translation was only used for the translation of technical documents.\par\par

    The 1980s saw the development of translation memory technology, which was the beginning of overcoming the challenge posed by the nuances of verbal communication, but the systems continued to face the same challenges in trying to convert a text into another language without losing its meaning.\par
    
    t was in 2000 when Franz JOsefOch, a computer scientist, won the machine translation contest that he became Google's Director of Translation Development. In 2012, Google announced its own translation application, Google translate. In addition, Japan is also leading the machine translation revolution with the creation of voice translation for mobile phones, which works in English, Japanese and Chinese. This is the result of the development of computer systems with a neural network model, rather than memory-based functions.\par
    
    That is why in 2016, Google informed the public that the application of a neural network technology improved the clarity of its translator, eliminating many of its errors. Called Google Neural Machine Translation (NMT), it began to translate language combinations that it had not been taught, for example, the programmers taught it to translate from English to Portuguese and Spanish, and it began to translate from Portuguese to Spanish without assigning it that combination.\par
